The dataset I will be using is the Yahoo question answering datasets. It has two main columns: the question column and the answer column. Let's get back to the notebook and the first thing to do is to install the datasets package, which is used to download datasets from Hugging Face. As you can see here, the dataset is available on Hugging Face. After this package is installed, we import from the dataset, we'll load the dataset function, we provide the name of the dataset we're interested in and only take the training set. We can check the size of the dataset by just typing the name of the variable, and we can see that we have 87,000+ observations in the dataset, which is a lot. So for the sake of simplicity, I'm just going to take a subset of 500. We can see that the result has changed—we have just selected 500—and now let's have a look at the first observation in the dataset: we have the ID of the dataset, the question, and also the answer. To be able to perform the fine-tuning, the dataset needs to be formatted in a specific way, and this general formatting is what we have here. We have a list of dictionaries. The first dictionary is about the role of the model, what we as a user want the model to perform as a task. This second dictionary is basically the question asked by the user, and finally, the last dictionary is the result provided by the assistant to the question given by the user. This is the formatting helper function that I have created. We have the input data and the formatted data, which is going to be arranged as follows: we have the role of the system and the content—you are the Yahoo platform's user assistant, please reply to users' answers using polite and respectful language. And now we have the role of the user, the content, and the user's question. This is the response within the training datasets, and finally, we shuffle.\n",

            "This allows the interaction with those agents. The final step is to execute the crew tasks. Now, this is my topic of interest. This is a topic that I want to write articles about, make LinkedIn posts, and also tweet. From that topic of interest, I can use my kickoff. That kickoff function is going to trigger the execution of all these agents, which will then process my topic of interest. Now, I can run this one, and here we can see that the processing is ongoing. This is entering the new crew agent executor chain. This chain is going to process all the tasks from agent number one to agent number four, and they're all working together to process my request and deliver my results. After all the tasks have been efficiently executed, we can see—let me check the output—here we have the expected three files: we have a blog markdown, LinkedIn markdown, and tweets markdown. Let's have a look at each file. Here we have the blog post: \"Creating a Personal Assistant Using GPT 3.5 Turbo F2.\" That's the topic that I was talking about in my video in that tutorial. The recent release of GPT-3.5 model for fine-tuning opens new possibilities. So as you can see, we have instructed the model with the introduction. The model gives an introduction, a step-by-step guide: it gives the first step, which is to install necessary packages; step two, load data; step three, format the data; step four, upload the data for fine-tuning. And here we have all the steps provided by the model and also the conclusion. This might not be perfect, but it gives you a perspective on the possibilities with this type of model. This is the blog post. Now let's have a look at the LinkedIn post. Here we have a LinkedIn post on fine-tuning GPT 3.5 Turbo with a graphical interface. Here, it is giving a brief summary of what has been discussed in the video along with the hashtags. And finally, the Twitter post, which is here: a short description from the video.\n",

And now, just provide the ID of the training dataset, which is going to be useful for fine-tuning the model in the next steps, and similarly for the validation data. These IDs are important for the fine-tuning process. For the fine-tuning, we need three main things: the model name, the training ID, and the validation ID. And now we can start the fine-tuning. The name is GPT 3.5 turbo model that we want to fine-tune, and we create a fine-tuning job by specifying that name, the upload training ID, and the upload validation ID. Once we have that, we just print the fine-tuning response, and as you can see here, the fine-tuning response is going to provide some useful information. Here, the model that we're using is GPT 3.5 Turbo 0613, and now we can see the status saying that the fine-tuning has been created and the number of epochs is three and train tokens. Here we can see that it's now—this is because once we trigger the fine-tuning, the result is not going to be automatically available. An important piece of information that we need to grab is the fine-tuning job ID, which is going to be used later for further processing. And now, let's check again the status of the fine-tuning response: fine-tuning job dot retrieve the fine-tuning job ID. So this is going to generate the state of the fine-tuning from the job ID, and here we can see that the fine-tuning has succeeded, meaning that we already have a model that has been fine-tuned. The number of epochs remains the same, and with train tokens, we have 100,000+ tokens generated from this fine-tuning process, and also the model created on the fine-tuned version of a model is this fine-tuned model.
